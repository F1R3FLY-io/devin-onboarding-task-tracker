# Feature Testing Report

## Overview
This report documents the testing of the enhanced features implemented in the Task Tracker application. Due to authentication issues, full interactive testing was not possible, but code examination confirms implementation of all requested features.

## Authentication Issues
- 401 Unauthorized errors when accessing `/api/auth`
- 400 Bad Request errors when accessing `/api/users`
- Backend server is running and MongoDB is connected
- Frontend environment variables are correctly configured

## Issues to Address in Next Step

### Critical Issues
1. **Authentication Problems**:
   - Fix 401/400 errors in authentication flow
   - Debug backend API routes for auth and users
   - Verify MongoDB connection and user model

### Minor Issues
1. **Theme Toggle Functionality**:
   - Verify dark mode implementation works correctly
   - Ensure theme persistence across page reloads

## Conclusion
All requested features have been implemented in the codebase, but authentication issues prevent full interactive testing. The next step should focus on resolving these authentication issues to enable complete testing of the implemented features.
