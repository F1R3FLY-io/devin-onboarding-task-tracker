# devin-onboarding-task-tracker
A great one-day test project for a junior full-stack developer that’s balanced in complexity is a “Task Tracker with Authentication”. It’s simple enough to complete in a day but complex enough to showcase skill.

# 📝 Task Tracker - Onboarding Project

Welcome to the Task Tracker onboarding challenge! This is a one-day project designed to evaluate your full-stack development skills across both frontend and backend domains. Please read the instructions carefully before you begin.

---

## 🚀 Objective

Build a basic Task Tracker web app that allows users to:

- Register and log in
- Create, read, update, and delete tasks
- Each task should include: `title`, `description`, `due date`, and `status` (`pending` / `completed`)
- Users should only see and manage their own tasks

---

## 🧰 Tech Requirements

You are free to use any stack you're comfortable with, but your solution **must** include:

- A **backend API** (REST or GraphQL) with authentication
- A **frontend** that consumes this API
- **Persistent storage** (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- Clear project structure and readable code

---

## ✅ Evaluation Criteria

- Functional and bug-free implementation
- Code quality, structure, and clarity
- Secure authentication and proper access control
- UI/UX design (basic but clean is fine)
- README quality and setup instructions
- Time management and completeness
