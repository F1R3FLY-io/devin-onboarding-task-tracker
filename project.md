# Task Tracker Project

## Project Goals

The Task Tracker application aims to provide users with a simple yet effective way to manage their tasks. The core functionality includes:

1. User authentication (register, login, logout)
2. Task management (create, read, update, delete)
3. Task filtering by user (users can only see and manage their own tasks)
4. Task status tracking (pending or completed)

Each task will include essential information such as title, description, due date, and status, allowing users to effectively organize and prioritize their work.

Tasks can be directly associated with ranking lists, creating a unified workflow between task management and prioritization. Users can toggle task status directly from the task cards and rename lists from the list view, enhancing the user experience.

## Chosen Stack: MERN

For this project, I've selected the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) for the following reasons:

1. **JavaScript Throughout**: Using JavaScript for both frontend and backend simplifies development and reduces context switching.

2. **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that provides flexibility for data modeling, easy scalability, and works well with Node.js through Mongoose ODM.

3. **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides robust features for web and mobile applications.

4. **React**: A powerful frontend library that enables building interactive UIs efficiently with component-based architecture and virtual DOM.

5. **Node.js**: An event-driven JavaScript runtime that allows for building scalable network applications.

6. **JWT Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens provide a secure and stateless authentication mechanism.

7. **Development Speed**: The MERN stack allows for rapid development with a large ecosystem of libraries and tools.

## Development Plan

### Phase 1: Project Setup (15%)
- Initialize backend with Express.js
- Set up MongoDB connection
- Create React frontend with TypeScript
- Configure necessary dependencies

### Phase 2: Backend Development (30%)
- Implement user authentication (register, login)
- Create data models (User, Task)
- Develop API routes for tasks (CRUD operations)
- Implement middleware for authentication and authorization

### Phase 3: Frontend Development (40%)
- Create authentication components (login, register)
- Develop task management components
- Implement state management with Context API
- Connect frontend to backend API
- Style the application with Tailwind CSS

### Phase 4: Testing and Debugging (10%)
- Test user authentication
- Verify task CRUD operations
- Ensure proper error handling
- Test user-specific task filtering

### Phase 5: Documentation and Finalization (5%)
- Update README with setup instructions
- Document API endpoints
- Finalize code organization and cleanup
