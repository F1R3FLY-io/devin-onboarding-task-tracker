# Task Tracker Project Summary

## Project Goals
- Create a Task Tracker web application with user authentication
- Allow users to register and log in securely
- Enable users to create, read, update, and delete their own tasks
- Each task should include title, description, due date, and status (pending/completed)
- Ensure users can only see and manage their own tasks
- Provide a clean, intuitive user interface

## Chosen Stack and Why

For this project, I've selected the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js):

### Backend
- **Node.js with Express.js**: Lightweight, fast, and perfect for building RESTful APIs
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database that provides flexibility for task data modeling and easy setup
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure, stateless authentication that works well with RESTful APIs

### Frontend
- **React**: Component-based UI library that enables rapid development of interactive interfaces
- **React Router**: For client-side routing
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for clean, responsive design

### Why This Stack?
1. **Development Speed**: The MERN stack allows for rapid development, crucial for a one-day project
2. **JavaScript Throughout**: Using JavaScript for both frontend and backend simplifies development
3. **Scalability**: While not immediately necessary, the stack can scale if needed
4. **Rich Ecosystem**: Abundant libraries and tools available for common functionalities
5. **Familiarity**: Widely used stack with extensive documentation and community support
