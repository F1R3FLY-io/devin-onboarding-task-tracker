# Tech Stack Decision

After careful consideration of the project requirements and constraints, I've selected the following tech stack for the Task Tracker application:

## Backend
- **Node.js with Express.js**: A lightweight and fast framework for building RESTful APIs
- **MongoDB**: A flexible NoSQL database that works well for document-based data like tasks
- **Mongoose**: ODM for MongoDB to simplify data modeling and validation
- **JWT Authentication**: For secure, stateless user authentication

## Frontend
- **React**: A component-based UI library for building interactive interfaces
- **React Router**: For client-side routing
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for clean, responsive design
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend API

## Rationale

1. **Time Efficiency**: The MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) allows for rapid development with JavaScript throughout the stack, which is crucial for a one-day project.

2. **Simplicity**: These technologies have straightforward setup processes and clear documentation.

3. **Authentication Support**: Express.js with JWT provides a simple way to implement secure authentication.

4. **Flexible Data Modeling**: MongoDB's schema-less nature allows for easy modeling of task data with fields like title, description, due date, and status.

5. **Component Reusability**: React's component-based architecture enables efficient UI development with reusable components.

6. **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS makes it easy to create a clean, responsive UI without writing custom CSS.

7. **Community Support**: All these technologies have large communities and extensive documentation, making problem-solving easier.

This stack meets all the technical requirements specified in the README:
- A backend API with authentication
- A frontend that consumes this API
- Persistent storage
- Clear project structure and readable code

The stack also avoids unnecessary complexity like containerization (Docker) or orchestration (Kubernetes), focusing instead on clarity, maintainability, and correctness.
