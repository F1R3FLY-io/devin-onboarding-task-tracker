## Testing Challenges

Testing was limited due to MongoDB connection issues:
```
MongoDB Connection Error: connect ECONNREFUSED ::1:27017, connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:27017
```

This indicates that MongoDB is not running or not accessible, which prevents full end-to-end testing of the application.

1. The TaskItem component now includes a status toggle button that updates the task status without requiring edit mode.
